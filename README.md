# MVP
This project will have a username and password login. Users will be able to query the edamam API(https://api.edamam.com/api/recipes/v2) with a simple keyword search, 
then select their favorite recipes to store.
(this will be added on after MVP has been built) Additionally Users will be able to pull up a list of their favorite recipes.
